# tic-tac-toe-cpp

Hello!

I understand that I have a TicTacToe implementation on this repository. The catch? It's in python and uses the min-max algorithm. I want to learn how to use c++ effectively for machine learning. In order to do this, the best way to learn in to jump in and code. This Tic Tac Toe project will be my first c++ project and my first step in learning c++. 

Goals:
1. To complete my first project in c++ and to learn the language. 
2. Practice writing clean code.
3. Take advantage of c++ performance. 

As I look through job applications for the positions I'd like to have one day, all of them use c++. So, here I am. If you find yourself in this repo from my YouTube channel, feel free to leave me a comment on the video on how to improve the code. I do check the comments!
